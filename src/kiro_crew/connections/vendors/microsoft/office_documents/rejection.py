"""The protected / unsupported-format rejection gate.

Every read, template-create and edit entry point runs a file through
:func:`classify` first, and refuses anything that is not a plain, unlocked
OOXML container this engine can safely handle. This is the campaign's one
``required=True`` Office operation: a document engine that silently mangled a
password-protected, macro-enabled, signed, IRM-protected or legacy-binary file
would produce output that opens broken, so the contract is **explicit refusal,
never silent corruption**.

Detection is by PRESENCE only, and deliberately so for signatures: whether a
signature is cryptographically *valid* is a different question this engine does
not answer. Academic work has shown structural signature presence and
cryptographic validity genuinely diverge, so conflating them would let this
engine make a claim it cannot back. It reports that a signature part EXISTS and
refuses to edit past it; it never asserts the signature verifies.
